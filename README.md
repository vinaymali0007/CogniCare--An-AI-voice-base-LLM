📝 Project Overview
CogniCare is an innovative, end-to-end AI system developed as a collaborative group project. It is designed to assist users in identifying potential health conditions through a combination of image and voice analysis. Acting as a first-line diagnostic assistant, CogniCare uses advanced AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to process user-provided inputs, generate a differential diagnosis, and communicate the results in a clear, conversational voice.

The project's core mission is to make healthcare more accessible and intuitive by leveraging multimodal AI to provide preliminary health insights, empowering users to make informed decisions about seeking professional medical care.

🚀 Key Features
Multimodal Input Processing: Seamlessly integrates data from two primary sources:

Image Analysis: Users can upload images (e.g., photos of a rash, a skin lesion, etc.) for visual analysis. Our computer vision models are trained to identify patterns and abnormalities indicative of various conditions.

Voice Analysis: Users describe their symptoms verbally. Our system uses a sophisticated speech-to-text engine and acoustic analysis to interpret both the content of their speech and subtle vocal markers that may be relevant to a diagnosis.

Intelligent Diagnostic Engine: At the heart of CogniCare is a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) that acts as a virtual diagnostician. This model processes and synthesizes the information from both image and voice inputs to generate a list of potential conditions (a differential diagnosis) along with a detailed explanation.

Intuitive Voice Output: The final diagnostic output from the LLM is converted into a natural-sounding, empathetic voice using a high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) engine. This conversational interface is designed to be user-friendly, reducing medical jargon and providing a comfortable experience.

End-to-End Workflow: The project is a complete pipeline, handling everything from data input and processing to the final voice-based output, all within a single, cohesive system.

⚙️ How It Works
User Input: The user provides an image and a verbal description of their symptoms.

Data Processing: The image is sent to an image analysis model, and the voice input is transcribed and analyzed.

LLM Integration: Both the visual data analysis and the transcribed voice data are fed into the central LLM.

Diagnostic Reasoning: The LLM leverages its extensive medical knowledge to synthesize this information and perform a differential diagnosis.

Voice Generation: The diagnostic summary is passed to a TTS engine, which generates a clear, conversational voice output for the user.

User Communication: The user hears the AI-generated diagnostic insights, including potential conditions and a disclaimer emphasizing the need for professional medical consultation.
